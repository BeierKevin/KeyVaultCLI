# KeyVaultCli.Domain.UnitTests

The KeyVaultCli.Domain.UnitTests project is a unit testing project for the KeyVaultCli application. It focuses on
testing the domain layer to ensure the correct implementation of business logic and to aid in maintaining the quality of
features as the project grows and evolves.

Here are the key test classes within the project:

1. VaultTests: Tests the Vault class which plays a critical role in the application. It handles password storage,
   retrieval, and updating.
2. VaultFactoryTests: Targets the VaultFactory class responsible for creating instances of the Vault class.
3. PasswordEntryBuilderTests: Tests the PasswordEntryBuilder class ensuring it correctly constructs PasswordEntry
   objects.

Tests in this project help verify several aspects such as correct behavior, error handling, and input validation.
The tests provide a safety net for developers, which helps to make the system more resilient against bugs and helps to
maintain consistent application behavior. It increases the confidence level of the development team when making changes
and adding new features.

Important: Running these tests every time you make changes to the Domain layer will help ensure your changes haven't
unintentionally affect the existing behavior. Regularly updating these tests when changes are made to the application
and when new features are added, is critical to maintaining a robust and reliable application.
